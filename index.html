      <h1>Hello, I'm Dominic!</h1>
      <h2>Toledo, Ohio.</h2>
      <h2>A game and car enthusiast.</h2>
      <p class="info">I want to be a International Business student at JAMK. I realize that I'm
      one of the 300 students applying to the program this year, so to show how motivated I am,
      I've decided to go a step further and created this website to show you how much I want to study at University of Applied Sciences of Jyväskylä.</p>
      <p class="info">Please scroll through my site, and hopefully I will get good news on Nov 24th!</p>

      <h1>Why JAMK?</h1>
      <p>Studying in <a href="https://www.jamk.fi/en/">JAMK</a> would help me to pursue my future career in Finland.
        There are many possibilities in Finland for me to explore my passions in its game and car industries.
        Finland is very known for its game companies such as Rovio and Supercell and for automobiles, there are the Mercedes Benz factory in Uusikaupunki
        and a supercar company called Toroidios. Right now I'd like to work for someone else but in the future, I might start my own company and the connections made in college would help me to do so.</p>
      <p>I have chosen to pursue an International Business degree because honestly, I prefer human sciences over hard sciences.
        In high school my favorite subject were psychology, social studies, and some aspects of physics.
      In this sense, choosing Academic Tracks like Marketing Management, Tech Business, or User Centric Design and Innovation
      on my second year would be great options for me to study. However, I'm not completely sure what I exactly want to do so an International Business degree would also keep many options open to me.</p>
      <p>When it comes to studying in Jyväskylä, the size of the city and nature really pulls me in. The stores and shops are close enough to walk or bike to and the air
      is fresher, unlike in Toledo.</p>

    <section class="benefit-for-future">
      <h1>How JAMK would benefit my future</h1>
      <p>JAMK would benefit my future both in Finland and outside of Finland in many ways. The most important impact would obviously be on my career path.
      International Business degree could help me to stick my foot into the door when it comes to the fields that I'm interested in even though my passions may change along the way.
      Learning Finnish during my studies would make job searching a lot easier in Finland. If I want to pursue an international career outside of Finland,
      this degree would grant that option as well.</p>
      <p>I believe that JAMK would also help me become more flexible with work and on a day to day basis because I would have to learn to cope with a certain uncertainty
      since I'd be living in a foreign country. In the university setting, I would become more familiar with doing science and how to distinguish good information from the bad.
      And best of all, I would learn about a new culture, Finnish people, and one of the hardest languages in the world!</p>

    <section class="motivation">
      <h1>What motivates me</h1>
      <p>Oh, there are many things that would motivate me during my studies. Like everyone, I wish for a better future. I especially wish to break
      the chains and be the first one of my family to go to college. I would also like to be able provide even better for my future family, particularly for my Finnish fiancée.</p>
      <p>Another big factor would be that I could be able to solve problems or be part of important solutions and that would make me feel like I matter to others around me.
      Then again, having fees is a pretty good incentive to make me want to graduate quickly, too. ;)</p>
